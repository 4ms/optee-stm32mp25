description: |
  STMicroelectronics's STM32 MPUs are able to monitor High Speed External
  oscillator frequency. Based on a lptimer, it is possible to detect a
  overclock frequency which can corrupt the system. The frequency overclock
  detection is detected thanks to High Speed Internal oscillator reference.

properties:
  compatible:
    const: st,freq-monitor
