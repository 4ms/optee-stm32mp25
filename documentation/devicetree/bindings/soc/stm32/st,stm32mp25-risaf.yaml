title: STM32 Resource isolation peripheral unit for address space protection
       (full version)

description: |
  The RIF (resource isolation framework) is a comprehensive set of hardware
  blocks designed to enforce and manage isolation of STM32 hardware resources,
  like memory and peripherals.
  Through RISAF registers, a trusted domain application, or the application to
  whom the configuration has been delegated, assigns memory regions and
  subregions to one or more security domains (secure, privilege, compartment).
  RISAF managing DRR includes the DDR memory cipher engine (DDRMCE) feature.

properties:
  compatible:
    enum:
     - st,stm32mp25-risaf
     - st,stm32mp25-risaf-enc

  reg:
    maxItems: 1

  clocks:
    const: 1

  st,mem-map:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32-array
    minItems: 2
    maxItems: 4
    description:
      Defines the memory range covered by the RISAF.

  memory-region:
    minItems: 1
    maxItems: 16
    description: |
      Phandle to a node describing memory area to be configured by the RISAF.
      These regions cannot overlap. A zone must be within st,mem-map range.

required:
  - compatible
  - reg
  - clocks
