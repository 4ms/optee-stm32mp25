    description:
      Describes the firewall hardware configuration to apply for a given
      resource.

      RIFPROT(hsem_res_id, sem_list, lock, sec, priv, scid, sem_en, cfen)

      When a field isn't effective, it should be filled with RIF_UNUSED.

        "hsem_res_id" The HSEM resource number.

        "sem_list" This peripheral does not support semaphores.
                   This field must be set to RIF_UNUSED.

        "lock" This peripheral does not support configuration locking.
               This field must be set to RIF_UNUSED.

        "sec" Configures secure-only access to the resource.
          RIF_SEC, only secure access is granted to the resource
          RIF_NSEC, secure/non-secure access is granted to the
                    resource

        "priv" Configures the privilege level needed to access this
               resource.
          RIF_PRIV, only privileged access is granted to the resource
          RIF_NPRIV, privileged/Unprivileged access is granted to the
                     resource

        "scid" Configures the static CID that is allowed to access the
               resource. Note that the static CID configuration is
               ineffective if the semaphore mode is enabled. Mandates CID
               filtering enabled to be effective.
          RIF_CID1 allows CID 1 to access the resource
          RIF_CID2 allows CID 2 to access the resource ...

        "sem_en" This peripheral does not support semaphores.
                 This field must be set to RIF_UNUSED.

        "cfen" Enable/disable the CID filtering for this resource.
          RIF_CFEN, enables the CID filtering
          RIF_CFDIS, disables the CID filtering
